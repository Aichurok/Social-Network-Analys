# Social-Network-Analys

At this project I did analysis of social network of the user which has 179 friend. First of all I get basic data about graph.
```
ecount(g)
vcount(g)
#The length of the longest shortest path
diameter(g)
get_diameter(g)
graph.density(g)
```
```
1294
179

+11/179 vertices, from a062e4e: 86 155 30 32 34 26 104 121 139 165 179 
0.08122528 
```
Further analysis considered distribution og the degree of verteces, shortest path between each pair of vertices. Structural analysis were done as well. I had investigated dergree centrality, closeness cerntrality, assortative mixing. On top of that clustering was done. So we can see formed groups which were connected by school, university , family and work. More information can be found on `sna_project.pdf`
